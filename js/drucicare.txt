    [Overall css: change the red color to one in your color scheme, maybe the blue with white text?],

    [Menu item Shopping Category: gives page that says Shopping Categories, I think that should be another page, similar to Shopping Category in the menu, but with the medicine categories instead of the single medicines, with each category going to a page with all the medicines for just that one category. (I believe we started working on this?)],

    [I would also move the Continue and Return to Shopping buttons more to the right, maybe near the subtotal column.

    [Current Order confirmation page:],
    [Maybe needs to be renamed Shipping/Billing info?],
    [Also needs the total.[Should not allow empty shipping/billing addresses. I suggest making a database table for addresses, then they can be saved so the client won't have to type them again.],
    [Add card/payment info, which also should not be allowed to be blank.],
    [Rename submit button to confirm order button which goes to a new Order Confirmation page.]
